## Why do we need MLE and GMM?

Sometimes, OLS is all we need
- The parameters we need to estimate are linear in the model
- Or they can be made linear with some clever transformation (like logs)

--

But, in many many cases, we need to estimate parameters that enter nonlinearly in the model
- We need to resort to nonlinear estimators

--

MLE and GMM are the most used estimators for structural modeling and estimation

---

## Maximum Likelihood in one slide

1. We observe some data `\((y_i, x_i), i=1,\dots,N\)` and assume it comes from a joint distribution described by parameter vector `\(\theta\)`

--

2. For any given `\(\theta\)` we can calculate the joint probability of our data
  - If observations are i.i.d., this joint probability is a product of individual probabilities of drawing `\((y_i, x_i)\)`

--

3. Using Bayes' rule, we can calculate the probability of `\(\theta\)` given `\((y_i, x_i)\)`: the **likelihood function**

--

4. The MLE estimate is the value of `\(\theta\)` that maximizes the likelihood: *we pick the parameters that make it most likely to generate the observed data*

---

## Maximum Likelihood intuition

Suppose we draw five numbers from a normal distribution: 
`$$y = {47.3, 51.2, 50.5, 44.9, 53.1}$$`

--

And we consider two candidate distributions: `\(N(0,1)\)` or `\(N(50, 1)\)`

--

- What is the likelihood of `\(N(0,1)\)` generating `\(y\)`? 
--
Virtually zero
  
--

- What is the likelihood of `\(N(50,1)\)` generating `\(y\)`? 
--
Definitely greater

--

So, between these two, we pick `\(\mu = 50\)`, since it's *more likely* to generate `\(y\)` than `\(\mu = 0\)`


---

## Maximum Likelihood example

Linear regression: we have `\(Y_{it} = X_i\beta + \epsilon_i\)` and assume `\(\epsilon_i | X_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)`

--

With i.i.d. observations, these imply the joint conditional density ($\phi$ is the normal PDF)

`$$f(Y_1,\dots\,Y_N|X_1,\dots\,X_N,\beta,\sigma^2) = \prod_{i=1}^N \phi(Y_i-X_i\beta,\sigma^2)$$`

--

By Bayes' rule
`$$\prod_{i=1}^N \phi(Y_i-X_i\beta,\sigma^2) \propto \prod_{i=1}^N \phi(Y_i-X_i\beta,\sigma^2) = L(\beta,\sigma^2|X,Y)$$`


---

## Maximum Likelihood example

Then, we use optimization methods to find
`$$(\hat{\beta}_{MLE},\hat{\sigma}^2_{MLE}) = \arg \max_{\beta,\sigma^2} L(\beta,\sigma^2|X,Y)$$`

- We can show that this solution is analytically equivalent to OLS

--

- As we saw it in the optimization tutorial, in practice we take logs to transform that product inside `\(L\)` into a sum
  - We maximize the *log-likelihood function* `\(l(\beta,\sigma^2|X,Y)\)`

---

## Generalized Method of Moments in one slide

1. Our economic model defines the following population moment conditions: at the true parameter `\(\theta_0\)`, `\(g(x;\theta)\)` are on average equal to zero
`$$E[g(x;\theta_0)] = 0$$`

--

2. We observe some data `\(x_i, i=1,\dots,N\)` and calculate sample analogue 
`$$E[g(x;\theta)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(x_i;\theta) \equiv g_N(\theta)$$`

--

3. The GMM estimate is given by ( `\(W_N\)` is a weighting matrix)
`$$\hat{\theta}_{GMM} = \arg \min_\theta g_N(\theta)^\prime \; W_N \; g_N(\theta)$$`

---

## (Generalized) Method of Moments intuition

Suppose we draw five numbers from an unknown distribution
`$$y = {47.3, 51.2, 50.5, 44.9, 53.1}$$`

--

Suppose this unknown distribution has mean `\(\mu\)`, giving a population moment condition

`$$E[y_i] = \mu \Rightarrow E[y_i - \mu] = 0$$`

--

We expect the population moment condition to also hold in the sample analogue

`$$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \mu) = 0$$`

---

## (Generalized) Method of Moments intuition

Forget the weighting matrix for now. We have one condition and one parameter, so this is effectively a special case: just *Method of Moments*

--

For our estimate, we pick `\(\hat{\mu}\)` that minimizes

$$\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{\mu})\right)^2 $$

In this simple case, this is just solving for `\(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{\mu}) = 0\)`


---

## Generalized Method of Moments example

Linear regression: again, we have `\(Y_{it} = X_i\beta + \epsilon_i\)`. But now, instead of normality, we assume `\(\epsilon_i\)` is orthogonal to data `\(X_i\)` (a `\(1 \times K\)` vector)
`$$E[x_{ki} \epsilon_i] = 0 \Rightarrow E[x_{ki} (Y_i - X_i\beta)] = 0$$`
- This actually gives `\(K\)` moment conditions: one for each variable `\(x_{ki} \in X_i\)`

--

We replace these `\(K\)` conditions with their respective sample analogues and solve for

`$$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ki} (Y_i - X_i \hat{\beta}) = 0$$`

--

- We can show that this solution is analytically equivalent to OLS, too


---

## MLE vs GMM

It's the same old **bias (or robustness) vs. efficiency trade-off**

--

- With MLE, we need to make assumption on distributions of unobservables
  - When our assumptions are correct, MLE is more efficient `\(\rightarrow\)` lower variance
  - Has good small sample properties (less bias, more efficiency with small data)
  - If our assumptions are inadequate, estimates are more biased
  
  
--

- With GMM, we don't need to assume distributions and can rely only on moment conditions from the theoretical and statistical model
  - This is more robust `\(=\)` less bias
  - Has good large sample properties (less bias, more efficiency with large data)
  - But it's in general less efficient than MLE `\(\rightarrow\)` higher variance

---

## Choosing between MLE and GMM

- *How much data is available?*
  - Large data sets favor GMM: good large sample properties require fewer assumptions. Smaller data sets might require stronger distributional assumptions `\(\rightarrow\)` MLE
--

- *How complex is the model?*
  - MLE is better suited for linear and quadratic models, but technically difficult to compute with highly nonlinear models. For the latter case, GMM might be better
--

- *How comfortable are you making distributional assumptions?*
  - MLE requires you to fully specify distributions. If there is good theoretical grounding for these assumptions, MLE is a good idea. Otherwise, GMM is the more attractive option

---

## Up next

We are going to review MLE and GMM with a focus on application: properties of these estimators and how to implement them in practice

--

We won't cover
- Proofs of asymptotic properties
- Small sample properties
- Hypothesis testing and model selection statistics
- Specialized numerical methods for their estimation

Some good textbooks to learn about these details: Wooldridge (PhD-level), Hayashi, Hansen, Greene

# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

---

## MLE: General case

1. Start with the **joint density of the data** `\(z_1, \dots, z_N\)` given by `\(f_Z(Z; \theta)\)`

--

2. Assuming an i.i.d. sample, construct the **log likelihood function**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
`$$l(\theta | Z) = \log\left(\prod_{i=1}^N f_Z(z_i;\theta)\right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log f_Z(z_i;\theta)$$`

--

3. Compute `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \arg \max_\theta l(\theta | Z)\)`

--

4. Compute `\(Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE})\)`, the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;We take logs to simplify computation. Log is a positive monotonic transformation, so it preserves the max.]



---

## Properties of MLE


Under some *regularity conditions*, MLE has the following properties


1. Consistency
2. Asymptotic normality
3. Asymptotic efficiency
4. Invariance

---

## Properties of MLE: Consistency

--

`$$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} \theta_0$$`

As sample size grows to infinity, `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)` gets arbitrarily close to the true parameter value, `\(\theta_0\)`

---

## Properties of MLE: Asymptotic normality

--

`$$\sqrt{N}(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}-\theta_0) \stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N}\left(0, I(\theta_0)^{-1}\right)$$`
where `\(I(\theta_0)\)` is the Fisher Information Matrix, given by

`$$I(\theta_0) = -E\left[\frac{\partial^2 l(\theta_0)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_0^{\prime}}\right]$$`

--

As the sample size grows to infinity, the distribution of `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)` converges to a normal distribution with mean as the true parameter value and a particular Variance-Covariance structure


---

## Properties of MLE: Asymptotic normality

Note that `\(I(\theta_0)\)` is the expectation of the Hessian of `\(l\)` evaluated at the true parameter
- This has a meaningful intuition: we are more certain of MLE estimates when the (log-) likelihood function has more curvature!

--

The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix is then given by
`$$Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}) = \left\{ -E\left[\frac{\partial^2 l(\theta_0)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_0^{\prime}}\right] \right\}^{-1}$$`
---

## Properties of MLE: Asymptotic efficiency


`\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)` achieves the Cramér-Rao lower bound

`$$Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}) = I(\theta_0)^{-1}$$`

- No consistent estimator has lower asymptotic variance than the MLE


---

## Properties of MLE: Invariance

Let `\(f(\theta_0)\)` be a continuous and continuously differentiable function. Then

`$$\widehat{f(\theta_0)}_{MLE} = f(\hat{\theta}_{MLE})$$`
- The MLE of a function of `\(\theta\)` is the function applied to the `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)` 

---

## MLE variance estimator

The variance-covariance matrix of the MLE can be estimated using

`$$Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}) = \left\{ \left. \frac{\partial^2 l(\theta)}{\partial \theta \partial \theta^{\prime}}\right|_{\theta=\hat{\theta}_{MLE}} \right\}^{-1}$$`
So we calculate the Hessian of `\(l\)` at the estimated parameter values.

- This is the simplest variance estimator. More robust estimators exist but are beyond our scope here


---

## Computing `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)`

We can use any of the maximization methods we've seen so far to calculate `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)`
- Unconstrained optimization with `Optim` (you can use the log/exp transformation to avoid domain problems with negative `\(\sigma^2\)`)
- Constrained optimization with `JuMP` (can set a constraint for `\(\sigma^2\ge0\)`)
- If closed-form derivatives of `\(l\)` are easy to obtain, you can use nonlinear rootfinding methods

--

There is a specialized Quasi-Newton method for MLE called *BHHH (Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman)*
- It has good properties approximating the Hessian of log-likelihoods and is faster than computing the actual Hessian every iteration

---

## Computing `\(Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE})\)`


To estimate the variance-covariance matrix, you can
- Derive the analytic Hessian (usually hard)
- Calculate it numerically using, for example, `ForwardDiff.hessian`

--

Once you've calculated the variance-covariance matrix, standard errors can be easily calculated as the square root of its diagonal elements
`$$SE(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}) = \sqrt{diag(Var(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}))}$$`

--


*For a step-by-step example of MLE, please review the optimization tutorial from unit 4*

# Generalized Method of Moments

---

## GMM: General case


1. Start with data `\(z_1, \dots, z_N\)` drawn from a population with `\(M\)` moment conditions that are functions of vector `\(\theta\)` with `\(K \leq M\)` parameters&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
`$$E[g(Z; \theta)] = 0$$`
.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The "generalized" in GMM comes from allowing more moment conditions than parameters; the "standard" Method of Moments requires M=K]

--

Where do moment conditions come from?
- Economic model conditions: first-order optimality, market clearing, zero arbitrage, etc 
- Statistical assumptions: error orthogonality `\((E[x\epsilon]=0)\)`
- Instruments orthogonality `\((E[z\epsilon]=0)\)`
- Model fit: predicted market shares are equal to realized market shares

---

## GMM: General case

2\. Construct empirical (sample analogue) moment conditions
`$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta) = 0$$`



---

## GMM: General case


3\. Compute the GMM estimate

`$$\hat{\theta}_{GMM} = \arg \min_\theta Q_N(\theta), \; Q_N(\theta) = \left[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta)\right]^\prime W \left[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta)\right]$$`
--

- If `\(M = K\)` and the problem is well-conditioned, then `\(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta) = 0\)` is `\(K\times K\)` (non)linear system and we can find the `\(\hat{\theta}\)` that solves it
--

- But if `\(M &gt; K\)`, we almost certainly can't find `\(K\)` parameters that satisfy more that `\(K\)` conditions simultaneously
  - So we look for parameters that get as close as possible to satisfying all moment conditions `\(\rightarrow\)` we minimize deviations from zero, weighted by a `\(M\times M\)` matrix `\(W\)`


---

## GMM: General case

4\. Compute `\(Var(\hat{\theta}_{GMM})\)`, the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates
- More on that soon

---

## Properties of GMM

Under some *regularity conditions*, MLE has the following properties


1. Consistency
2. Asymptotic normality

--
- Note that, unlike MLE, GMM is not asymptotically efficient

These properties require some assumptions on the empirical moments

---

## Properties of GMM: empirical moments assumption

We assume the following about empirical moments at the true parameter value, `\(\theta_0\)`

1. Empirical moments obey the law of large numbers
`$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta_0) \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} 0$$`

--

2. The derivatives of the empirical moments converge to the `\(M \times K\)` Jacobian matrix
`$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left.\frac{\partial g(z_i; \theta)}{\partial \theta^\prime}\right|_{\theta=\theta_0} \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}  D_0 \equiv D(\theta_0) = E\left[\frac{\partial g(z_i; \theta_0)}{\partial \theta_0^\prime}\right]$$`

---

## Properties of GMM: empirical moments assumption

3\. Empirical moments obey the central limit theorem
`$$\sqrt{N}\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g(z_i; \theta_0) \stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N}(0, S_0)$$`

where `\(S_0 = E[g(z_i; \theta_0) g(z_i; \theta_0)^\prime]\)` it the variance-covariance matrix of moments (an `\(M\times M\)` matrix)

--

- We also need to assume that the weighting matrix converges to `\(W_0\)`, a finite symmetric positive definite matrix

`$$W \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}W_0$$`

---

## Properties of GMM: consistency
`$$\hat{\theta}_{GMM} \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} \theta_0$$`

As sample size grows to infinity, `\(\hat{\theta}_{GMM}\)` gets arbitrarily close to the true parameter value, `\(\theta_0\)`

---

## Properties of GMM: Asymptotic normality

--

`$$\sqrt{N}(\hat{\theta}_{GMM}-\theta_0) \stackrel{d}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N}\left(0, V_0\right)$$`
where `\(V_0\)` has a typical *sandwich form*

`$$V_0 = \underbrace{(D_0^\prime W_0 D_0)^{-1}}_{\text{bread}}\underbrace{(D_0^\prime W_0 S_0 W_0 D_0)}_{\text{filling}} \underbrace{(D_0^\prime W_0 D_0)^{-1}}_{\text{bread}}$$`

--

As the sample size grows to infinity, the distribution of `\(\hat{\theta}_{GMM}\)` converges to a normal distribution with mean as the true parameter value and a particular Variance-Covariance structure


---

## GMM variance estimator

Any valid weighting matrix `\(W\)` yields a consistent GMM estimator

But the choice of `\(W\)` affects variance, so we want to use some optimal `\(W\)` that minimizes the variance of the estimator


--

It can be shown that the **optimal weigthing matrix** is given by

`$$W_0 = S_0^{-1} = \left\{E[g(z_i; \theta_0) g(z_i; \theta_0)^\prime]\right\}^{-1}$$`

which yields

`$$Var(\hat{\theta}_{GMM}) = (D_0^\prime W_0 D_0)^{-1}$$`
